    "Multithreading in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single Python process. Each thread represents a separate unit of execution, and multithreading allows these threads to run concurrently, sharing the same memory space. It's a way to perform multiple tasks or processes simultaneously in order to improve program performance and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Multithreading is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance: Multithreading can lead to improved program performance, especially when dealing with I/O-bound or CPU-bound tasks, by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: It helps create responsive applications, such as user interfaces, where tasks can run concurrently without blocking the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multithreading allows for parallel execution of tasks, which is essential for tasks that can be executed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Code: It simplifies code for certain tasks that can be broken down into smaller, concurrent subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module for Handling Threads in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary module used to handle threads in Python is the threading module. The threading module provides a high-level, object-oriented interface to create and manage threads in Python. It offers classes and functions to create, start, and synchronize threads, making it relatively easy to work with multithreading in Python.\n",

    "Thread Safety:\n",
